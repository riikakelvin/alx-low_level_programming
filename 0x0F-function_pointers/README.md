README file for 0x0F-function_pointers, using prototype fucntion void array_iterator(int *array, size_t size, void (*action)(int)), with array, where size is the size of the array, and actio is the pointer to the needed fucntion for the program to work well. Also, int int_index(int *array, int size, int (*cmp)(int)) prototype used to Write a function that searches for an integer. It contains an array under consideration,  size, rep size of array, and cmp is  pointer to the function to be used to compare values
